# Memo
This is a minimalistic PHP script for storing memos.  
No libraries required, all the necessary PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is in one .php file.  
No login required, instead use a URL that only you know.  
No database required, it saves the data to a text file.  
It should work fine even with older PHP, in bad browsers and on mobile devices.  
It displays a nice check mark next to the Save button for 3 seconds so that you know that your data has been saved successfully.
